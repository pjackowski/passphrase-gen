# passphrase-gen

The project inspired by `pwgen` Linux command-line utility.

Script generates lists of words from the supplied dictionary.

Pick at least three to create a memorable and strong passphrase.

Put the default dictionary `corncob-lowercase.txt` in the same directory as the script.

## Sample output
